# Unexpected Behavior in Express.js Route Parameter Handling

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in Express.js route parameter handling where unexpected behavior can occur if the route parameter is not properly validated. 

## Bug Description

The provided code snippet shows a route handler that fetches user data based on a user ID passed as a route parameter. The issue arises if the `req.params.id` is not a number, as it may lead to issues when fetching data from the database or during other operations that depend on the `id` parameter being an integer.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation to ensure that the route parameter is an integer before proceeding with the database interaction or other operations. This prevents unexpected behavior or errors that may occur due to invalid parameter types.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
5. Make a request to `/users/abc` or `/users/123a` to see the erroneous behavior.
6. Run `node bugSolution.js` to observe the fix.
